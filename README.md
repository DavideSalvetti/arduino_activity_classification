<h1> Project Description </h1>
The aim of this project is to classify the following physical activities: standing, walking, jumping and cycling. All the data come from an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, a powerful Arduino board that has a lot of sensors on board, like an IMU, temperature and humidity sensors. The Arduno Nano 33 BLE Sense is placed above the ankle of the left leg: it collects data and, through an on board NN, classifies them. The Arduno uses BLE to communicate with a mobile phone app, developed with Qt 5.15.
